An application to remove  tf2 spray files

it's best to only install the SprayRemoverTF.exe file and not the .zip or .targz files

To use place the .exe to your tf/custom folder. Should be in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf\custom
The app should run every time you close Team Fortress 2.
